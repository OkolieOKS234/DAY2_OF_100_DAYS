# DAY2_OF_100_DAYS
DAY 2 of the 100 days of code

Today I learnt about the Spread Operator and the Rest Operator

The spread operator is used when adding elements to an array of object e.g
const daysOfTheWeek = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"];
const fullDaysOfTheWeek = [...daysOfTheWeek, "Thursday", "Friday"];
console.log(fullDaysOfTheWeek);
it prints [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday]

and also arrow functions

const name = ()=>{
//do something
}
